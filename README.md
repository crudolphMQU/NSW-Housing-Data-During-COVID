# Project Summary
In this project, we have chosen to analyse the property price trends in NSW, Australia. 

Given the real estate market activity in NSW, we were curious to see how the relationship between housing data, demographics, 
and certain economic factors interact with one another. 
Also, we were curious whether we could predict housing data in each postcode with these variables.

We will explore questions such as:
- [x] Where should one buy a home?
- [x] Can we predict prices based on socioeconomic data such as income levels, household size, or interest rates?
- [x] Can we predict which postcodes will grow faster than average?
